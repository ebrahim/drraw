* Keep up with RRDTOOL:
	- start/end/step parameters for DEF
	- new TICK/PART commands
	- redefined PRINT/GPRINT
	- STACK/HRULE deprecation
	- ..?

* More JavaScript where possible and harmless to improve the interface.

The following random ideas may be worth implementing, or not.
At this point, it seems unlikely that they will be, so if you really care
for one of these, you should either (1) write the code yourself and
contribute it, or (2) consider sponsoring development:

  * Dashboard style display for templates & dashboards
    (e.g. multiple base selections)

  * Allow events to be displayed using a set of colors

  * Presenting graphs as imagemaps for easier navigation

  * Adding links to allow the user to dump the graphed data as CSV
