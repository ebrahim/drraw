# User authentication/validation handling is left up to the web server.  In

# Authenticated users automatically set the level to 2 unless the username
# is found in %users (below) in which case the level is set accordingly to
# what is defined.
# Unauthenticated users get the 'guest' username.

# By default, drraw will use the REMOTE_USER environment variable to find
# the user's username.  If you wish to use something else, simply define
# the following subroutine.
# NOTES: (1) drraw will fall back to using the REMOTE_USER environment variable
#            if this subroutine returns 'undef': use 'guest' if you wish to
#            leave the user unauthenticated.
#        (2) this subroutine may manipulate the %users array based on external
#            data allowing to process authentication entirely out of this
#            configuration file.

# If you have many RRD files and templates, indexes can become extremely
# big and slow to load.  This variable allows you to prevent all templates
# choices from being displayed in the indexes based on how many choices
# are available per template.

# Custom Index Definition
#
# Custom Indexes are defined as a HASH:
#  - Each key is the name that will be presented to the user
#  - Keys are sorted when the index is built
#  - If a key matches ^\d+\s+(\S.*)$ then only $1 will be shown
#    (This allows for keys to be sorted independently of what is shown.)
#  - The value for a given key must be one of the following:
#    - A  HASH   (for nested indexes)
#    - A  SCALAR (for leaves) which will be matched as a regular expression
#      against the Graph titles, Template titles and Dashboard titles.
#      Matching titles will be presented to the user.
#    - An ARRAY  (for leaves) containing 3 elements.  Each element will be
#      matched as a regular expression against the Graph titles, Template
#      titles and Dashboard titles (respectively).  Matching titles will
#      be presented to the user.
#
# For example:
# %Index = ( '1 Network' => { 'Cisco' => [ undef, 'Cisco', 'Cisco' ],
#                             'Interfaces Statistics' => 'Interface',
#                             'Miscellaneous' => [ 'Traffic', '(DMZ Traffic|Firewall)', undef ],
#                             'VPN' => 'VPN' },
#            '2 Storage' => [ undef, '(Disk|SAN)', '(Disk|SAN)' ],
#            '3 UNIX' => [ '(Solaris|BSD)', '(Solaris|BSD)', 'UNIX' ],
#            '4 Windows => [ 'Windows', 'Windows', 'Windows' ],
#            '5 Environmental' => [ 'Datacenter', undef, 'Datacenter' ] );
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: Nested indexes are implemented using JavaScript.
