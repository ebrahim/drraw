Description: A simple web based presentation front-end for RRDtool
 drraw is a simple web based presentation front-end for RRDtool that allows you
 to interactively build graphs of your own design. A graph definition can be
 turned into a template which may be applied to many Round Robin Database files.
 drraw specializes in providing an easy mean of displaying data stored with
 RRDtool and does not care about how the data is collected, making it a great
 complement to other RRDtool front-ends.
